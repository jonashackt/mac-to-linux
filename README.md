# mac-to-linux
Experimenting with leaving my Mac in favour of a Linux machine


## Why going from Mac to Linux?

After many years (8+) of using a MacBook and fancy Apple stuff I found myself in thinking about leaving the golden cage.

I already dropped my iPhone in favour of an Android phone (currently Samsung Galaxy S23, mainly because of the great camera, the small form factor and the long update period) - and I don't really use iPhoto and others anymore. Also tethering doesn't work between an Android phone and a Mac (really! in 2023). 

Since I had a hard accident this year with a long recovery period I started to build a gaming PC just for fun - after maybe 10 years! At first I thought it was because I really wanted to play the new Diablo version (I loved the old v2 back when I was a teenager), but I experienced the fun building your own rig the way YOU want it. From the parts YOU choose from the MARKET or used market prices (and NOT from Apple prices).

And I remembered my old values of free standards, free software, free choice... wow - why did I opt for Apple devices in the first place?

So as time went by the thought of switching my main machine from Mac to a Linux box got bigger and bigger. Finally I cought myself in reading through laptop tests at https://www.notebookcheck.com :)


## Choosing a distro

That one is hard. Because if you ask, everybody yells at you :D 

So beeing a software architect I know the only way to get around the discussions is to define your requirements.

I tried to come up with some:

* Rolling releases: I hate big releases! So I don't want to reinstall my system every year like most of the people are used to from MacOS, Ubuntu, Fedora etc. I want a rolling release distro.

`tbd: more info on distro choosing`

Finally I opted for Manjaro Linux https://manjaro.org/, which is based on Arch Linux.


## Docker

Is there a way to install and use Docker on Linux? Yes I know: Linux containers were invented ON Linux. So why do we need Docker at all?

But having the ease of use of my beloved command line tooling would be great to make the switch as easy as possible.

There seems to be kind of an semi official Docker release from the creators (see https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/archlinux/). But the problem is, the installation is [based on a binary you need to update manually](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/binaries/#install-daemon-and-client-binaries-on-linux) - wow, in 2023?! 

But luckily we can simply use the power of the [Arch User Repository (AUR)](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/docker#Installation) - and install Docker via the following commands:

```
pamac install docker
systemctl start docker.service
```

That should be everything to fire up our first Docker container on Linux:

`sudo docker run -it --rm archlinux bash -c "echo hello world"`

Since we also want to be able to run our `docker` command without `sudo` (and we NEED to run it without sudo for the `MacOs on Linux` part), we need to do [the following steps according to the Arch package wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/docker#Installation): 

> If you want to be able to run the docker CLI command as a non-root user, add your user to the docker user group, re-login, and restart docker.service. 

(but there's also a warning: `Warning: Anyone added to the docker group is root equivalent because they can use the docker run --privileged command to start containers with root privileges.`)

So here we go:

```
sudo usermod -aG docker "${USER}"
```

Log out and log back in so that your group membership is re-evaluated - or even restart your machine to make the changes take effect. Maybe also `newgrp docker` should be enough.

Restart the Docker service via:

```
systemctl restart docker
```

Now we should be able to run docker without sudo:

```
docker run -it --rm archlinux bash -c "echo hello world"
```





## MacOS on Linux

You may already guessed it: I will need MacOS for some time to follow - just to be able migrate some workflows I created over all those years. And also to use Samsung Smart Switch, my tax software and others. So is there a problem to run MacOS virtualized on Linux?

First I thought about using VirtualBox to do the job - but then I read statements like: "It could work (after many crazy configuration steps) - but then you shouldn't do an upgrade ever, since it may stop working right after the update". What...?! OMG.

See https://najigram.com/2022/01/run-macos-in-virtualbox-on-linux-os/, https://github.com/hkdb/VBoxMacSetup, https://www.macwelt.de/article/1506511/macos-ventura-mit-virtualbox-als-vm-betreiben.html




## MacOS as Docker container on Linux

But then I had an idea: Why not use containers to do the job? And a quick google search got me to https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX 

Let's try this out! First we need to [get some prerequisites ready](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX?utm_source=pocket_saves#initial-setup):

> Before you do anything else, you will need to turn on hardware virtualization in your BIOS.

Now if you have hardware virtualization activated, we need to install some packages:

```
sudo pamac install qemu libvirt qemu-desktop dnsmasq virt-manager bridge-utils flex bison iptables-nft edk2-ovmf
```

Since pamac [will prompt you for optional dependencies](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/1z9y3l/install_optional_dependencies/), I choosed `none` and used `2:  qemu-desktop  8.1.0-2  extra` as the QEMU provider.

Now we also need to enable libvirt and load the KVM kernel module:

```
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
sudo systemctl enable --now virtlogd

echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/kvm/parameters/ignore_msrs

sudo modprobe kvm
```

Finally we should be able to run a MacOS Docker container like [Monterey](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX#monterey-) or [Ventura](https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX#ventura-) or the default Catalina:

```
docker run -it \
    --device /dev/kvm \
    -p 50922:10022 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    -e "DISPLAY=${DISPLAY:-:0.0}" \
    sickcodes/docker-osx:latest
```

It's important to run the `docker` command without `sudo` (see https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX/issues/91#issuecomment-786794711):

> Run without sudo (GTK can't run in roots desktop because root isn't running a display server.)

Now we should see a QEMU firing up running MacOS in recovery mode:

## Troubleshooting MacOS in Docker

see also https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX#troubleshooting

I had some issues getting the container to run.

#### iptables

```
iptables: No chain/target/match by that name
```

See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31667160/running-docker-container-iptables-no-chain-target-match-by-that-name - clearing all the chaings fixed it for me:

```
sudo iptables -t filter -F
sudo iptables -t filter -X
systemctl restart docker
```

#### gtk initialization failed

```
alsa: Could not initialize ADC
alsa: Failed to open `default':
alsa: Reason: No such file or directory
ALSA lib confmisc.c:855:(parse_card) cannot find card '0'
ALSA lib conf.c:5181:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_card_inum returned error: No such file or directory
ALSA lib confmisc.c:422:(snd_func_concat) error evaluating strings
ALSA lib conf.c:5181:(_snd_config_evaluate) function snd_func_concat returned error: No such file or directory
ALSA lib confmisc.c:1334:(snd_func_refer) error evaluating name

alsa: Could not initialize ADC
alsa: Failed to open `default':
alsa: Reason: No such file or directory

gtk initialization failed
```

As described here https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX/issues/91#issuecomment-786794711 execute the following:

```
xhost +
```



## Install MacOS in the MacOS Docker container

As we saw the container is starting a bare Mac system in the recovery mode. Without manually reinstalling MacOS, we aren't able to use any software.

But reinstalling MacOS doesn't work out-of-the box inside the container using the wizard, because no disk is available for installation.

Therefore head over to the disk utilities and erase the biggest QEMU harddrive with around 200gb and name it e.g. `MyDockyOSX`.

Then the MacOS install wizard should show the `MyDockyOSX` disk as a possible installation harddrive:

![](mac-os-in-docker-install-wizard.png)

No worries: it's a virtual drive and only grows as needed :)

This actually may take a while!
