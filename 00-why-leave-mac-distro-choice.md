# 00 Why going from Mac to Linux?

After many years (nearly 9) of using a MacBook and fancy Apple stuff I found myself in thinking about leaving the golden cage.

I already dropped my iPhone in favour of an Android phone (currently Samsung Galaxy S23, mainly because of the great camera, the small form factor and the long update period) - and I don't really use iPhoto and others anymore. Also tethering doesn't work between an Android phone and a Mac (really! in 2023). 

Since I had a hard accident this year with a long recovery period I started to build a gaming PC just for fun - after maybe 10 years! At first I thought it was because I really wanted to play the new Diablo version (I loved the old v2 back when I was a teenager), but I experienced the fun building your own rig the way YOU want it. From the parts YOU choose from the MARKET or used market prices (and NOT from Apple prices).

And I remembered my old values of free standards, free software, free choice... wow - why did I opt for Apple devices in the first place?

So as time went by the thought of switching my main machine from Mac to a Linux box got bigger and bigger. Finally I cought myself in reading through laptop tests at https://www.notebookcheck.com :)


## Choosing a distro: Why not going rolling release & AUR?

That one is hard. Because if you ask, everybody yells at you :D 

So beeing a software architect I know the only way to get around the discussions is to define your requirements.

I tried to come up with some:

* Rolling releases: I hate big releases! So I don't want to reinstall my system every year like most of the people are used to from MacOS, Ubuntu, Fedora etc. I want a rolling release distro.

There are some popular options with rolling releases like https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=endeavour

Here's a great example, why Manjaro is a fantastic choice for software developers: You get up to date versions of the libraries you want - in the default system package manager: https://rclone.org/install/#package-manager and this image:

Finally I opted for Manjaro Linux https://manjaro.org/, which is based on Arch Linux.
