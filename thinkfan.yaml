# Sensor Drivers and Temperature Inputs
# =====================================
#
# ATTENTION: The order in which sensors are specified here is significant when
# specifying the fan speeds further below!
#
# The "correction:" and "optional:" keywords may be specified on any type of
# sensor.

sensors:
  # This config works, but the hwmonNUMBER changes after boot - thus resulting in manual work
  # everytime you boot (using sudo pwmconfig list to see the current pwm file)
  # - hwmon: /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon6/temp6_input
  # - hwmon: /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon6/temp3_input
  # - hwmon: /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon6/temp7_input
  # - hwmon: /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon6/temp4_input
  # - hwmon: /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon6/temp1_input
  # #- hwmon: /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon4/temp5_input
  # #- hwmon: /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon4/temp2_input

  # Because of that, I went with the more robust base path search method:
  # CPU Cores
  - hwmon: /sys/devices/platform
    name: coretemp # use coretemp instead of actual coretemp.0, which will lead to error: Could not find a hwmon with this name
    indices: [1, 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]

  # Chassis
  - hwmon: /sys/devices/platform
    name: thinkpad # use thinkpad instead of actual thinkpad_hwmon, which will lead to error: Could not find a hwmon with this name
    indices: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7] # leave out 2, 5 & 8, since this sensor is always broken and gives: Failed to read temperature(s) from /sys/devices/platform/thinkpad_hwmon/hwmon/hwmon5/temp8_input: No such device or address

  # The SSDs have a stable path with their pci address
  # SSD
  - hwmon: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/0000:06:00.0/nvme/nvme0/hwmon3/temp1_input
  - hwmon: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:06.0/0000:06:00.0/nvme/nvme0/hwmon3/temp2_input


  # hwmon: Full path to a temperature file (single sensor).
  # =======================================================
  # Disadvantage is that the index in "hwmon0" depends on the load order of
  # the driver modules, which may change across bootups on some systems.
  # - hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/temp1_input

  # hwmon: Path to a complete driver folder
  # =======================================
  # Individual sensors need to be picked out with the "indices:" keyword.
  # This can be used with a stable path that does not depend on driver load
  # order. However certain drivers may not appear under such a stable path.
  # - hwmon: /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:27:00.0/hwmon
  #   indices: [1, 2, 5, 6] # adds 4 temperature sensors
  #   correction: [0, 0, 0, -5] # add -5 Â°C to temp6_input

  # hwmon: Base path with name-based search
  # =======================================
  # Thinkfan will search under the given path for a hwmon driver that has a
  # file called "name" which contains the given name. This method should work
  # with all hwmon drivers and is robust against driver load order.
  # - hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon
  #   name: k10temp
  #   indices: [1]

  # Sensors can also be optional, e.g. in case of removable hardware
  # - hwmon: /sys/class/block/sdc/device/hwmon
  #   indices: [1]
  #   optional: true # don't exit if the sensor can't be read

  # atasmart: Read the temperature from a hard disk via S.M.A.R.T
  # =============================================================
  # Note that this is unreasonably CPU-intensive. Since Linux 5.6, the kernel
  # can report the temperatures of hard disks via the hwmon interface (see the
  # example above), which should be preferred if available.
  #
  # This is only available if thinkfan was compiled with USE_ATASMART enabled.
  #- atasmart: /dev/sda

  # tpacpi: Legacy interface to the thinkpad_acpi driver
  # ====================================================
  # Particularly on older Thinkpad laptops, this interface may give access to
  # 8-16 temperature sensors, but it may be hard to tell where/what exactly
  # they measure.
  # Some documentation for older models may be found at the thinkpad wiki:
  # https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Thermal_Sensors
  #
  # Note that the hwmon interface is to be preferred nowadays.
  # - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal
  #   # Some of the temperature entries in /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal may be
  #   # irrelevant or unused, so individual ones can be selected:
  #   indices: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# avoid using nvml option (temperatures read from proprietary nVidia GPU driver).
# Using nvml prevents the GPU from switching to suspend power state, causing battery drain and high temperatures.

  # nvml: The proprietary nVidia driver
  # ===================================
  # Temperatures can be read directly from nVidia GPUs that run with the
  # proprietary driver. The "nvml:" entry must specify the PCI bus ID of the
  # GPU (can be found with lspci)
  #
  # Note that this does not work with the open-source "nouveau" driver. Open
  # source drivers should support the hwmon interface instead (see above).
  #- nvml: 01:00.0

# Fan Drivers
# ===========
#
# Currently, thinkfan supports only one fan, but support for multiple fans is
# in development and will be released soon. For the time being, the examples
# given below are mutually exclusive.
#
fans:
  # hwmon: Full path to a PWM file
  # ==============================
  # Also subject to the potential problem with driver load order (see above)
  # - hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon/hwmon6/pwm1

  # hwmon: Path to a complete driver folder
  # =======================================
  # - hwmon: /sys/class/graphics/fb0/device/hwmon
  #   indices: [1] # Use pwm1

  # hwmon: Base path with name-based search
  # =======================================
  # - hwmon: /sys/class/hwmon
  #   name: amdgpu
  #   indices: [1]

  # tpacpi: Thinkpad-specific fan interface
  # =======================================
  # Currently, this is the only way to use disengaged and automatic mode on
  # thinkpads.
  - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

##############################################################################


##############################################################################
# Fan Speeds (simple mode)
# ========================
# 
# In simple mode, each entry is a [FANSPEED, LOWER_LIMIT, UPPER_LIMIT] tuple.
# This is a quick way to configure a small system like a laptop, where the
# temperature ratings for all monitored devices are similar. Only the highest
# temperature found across all sensors will be compared against these limits.
# All other temperatures are ignored.
#
# Correction values on individual sensors (see above) may be used to equalize
# small discrepancies in temperature ratings.
#
# The FANSPEED values in this example are valid for the thinkpad_acpi fan
# driver only (see above)
#
levels:
  - [0, 0, 75]
  - [1, 74, 80]
  - [2, 79, 87]
  - [3, 86, 90]
  - [7, 89, 255]
  #- ["level auto", 45, 75]
  #- ["level disengaged", 70, 255]

##############################################################################
# Fan Speeds (detailed mode)
# ==========================
#
# It is generally advisable to configure the temperature limits for each
# sensor individually.
#
# The speed values used here range from 0 to 255, which is valid for the PWM
# control files used by hwmon-based drivers.
#
# The temperatures specified in upper_limit and lower_limit apply to the
# sensors in the same order in which they were specified in the "sensors:"
# section above, and their length must match the total number of sensors that
# have been configured.
#
# levels:
#   - speed: 0
#     upper_limit: [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50]

#   # - speed: 30
#   #   lower_limit: [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50]
#   #   upper_limit: [56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56, 56]

#   - speed: 70
#     lower_limit: [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50]
#     upper_limit: [65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65]

#   - speed: 100
#     lower_limit: [65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65, 65]
#     upper_limit: [75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75]

#   - speed: 160
#     lower_limit: [75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75, 75]
#     upper_limit: [85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85]

#   - speed: 255
#     lower_limit: [85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, 85]
