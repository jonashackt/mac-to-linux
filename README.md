Experimenting with leaving my Mac in favour of a Linux machine


## Why going from Mac to Linux?

After many years (8+) of using a MacBook and fancy Apple stuff I found myself in thinking about leaving the golden cage.

I already dropped my iPhone in favour of an Android phone (currently Samsung Galaxy S23, mainly because of the great camera, the small form factor and the long update period) - and I don't really use iPhoto and others anymore. Also tethering doesn't work between an Android phone and a Mac (really! in 2023). 

Since I had a hard accident this year with a long recovery period I started to build a gaming PC just for fun - after maybe 10 years! At first I thought it was because I really wanted to play the new Diablo version (I loved the old v2 back when I was a teenager), but I experienced the fun building your own rig the way YOU want it. From the parts YOU choose from the MARKET or used market prices (and NOT from Apple prices).

And I remembered my old values of free standards, free software, free choice... wow - why did I opt for Apple devices in the first place?

So as time went by the thought of switching my main machine from Mac to a Linux box got bigger and bigger. Finally I cought myself in reading through laptop tests at https://www.notebookcheck.com :)
